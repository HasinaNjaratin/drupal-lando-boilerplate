# Composer template for Drupal projects

This project template provides a starter kit for managing your site
dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).


## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar)
for your setup.

After that you clone this project and run

```
composer install
```

With `composer require ...` you can download new dependencies to your
installation.
Example:
```
cd some-dir
composer require drupal/devel:~1.0
```

Use `settings.local.php` to config local settings.

### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull
request is often a better solution), you can do so with the
[composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra
section of composer.json:
```
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL or local path to patch"
        }
    }
}
```

### How do I specify a PHP version ?

This project supports PHP 5.6 as minimum version (see [Drupal 8 PHP requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/system-requirements/drupal-8-php-requirements)), however it's possible that a `composer update` will upgrade some package that will then require PHP 7+.

To prevent this you can add this code to specify the PHP version you want to use in the `config` section of `composer.json`:
```
"config": {
    "sort-packages": true,
    "platform": {
        "php": "5.6.40"
    }
},
```
